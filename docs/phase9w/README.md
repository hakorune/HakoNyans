# Phase 9w Docs Structure

Phase 9w speed docs are split into three layers:

- `docs/phase9w/SPEED_STATUS.md`
  - current baseline, current decisions, and next tasks
- `docs/phase9w/INDEX.md`
  - entry index with links to detailed logs and archive no-go records
- `docs/phase9w/logs/*.md`
  - detailed box-by-box records (objective/scope/gate/result/decision)

Legacy large log entrypoint is kept at:
- `docs/PHASE9W_SPEED_OPTIMIZATION_LOG.md`

It now works as a thin hub to the files above.
